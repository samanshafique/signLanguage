      "Sign Languages have most likely existed for as long as Deaf people have come together to communicate that is, we can assume that sign languages are as old as humain communication. Over the millennia sign languages have changed and disappeared, while new ones have come into existence (Armstrong strokoe & wilcox 1994, 1995; Lane Pillard & French 2000). Sign Languages are used in Deaf Communities around the world. Each communities uses its own unique sign language. There are Links and Similarities between sign languages in the same wat that spoken languages fall into group of languages families. Certain communities have adopted naturally or through languages planning, the sign language of another deaf community. \nSign Languages have been systematically studied as languages only since the 1950’s and early 1960’s (e.g. Tervoort 1959; Stokoe, Casterline & Croneberg 1965). While a formal Linguistic description  was being proposed for American Sign Languages (ASL), Tervoort Trackled the  question  of  how these languages  were acquired by young deaf children (Tervoort 1953, 1959). Since these  ground breaking efforts, studies have not only been carried out on Deaf children but also hearing children raised in sign envoirments and the acquisition by both  groups of sign languages as  a first language.\nWhile sign languages are ruled-governed  in similar ways to spoken languages the  the specific grammatical processes in each  language are linked to the demands of the modality.\nSign languages have been described as having a  phonological structure made up of 5 parameters; handshape, movement, location hand orientation and faical expression (e.g Siedlecki & Bonvillian 1993). The term phonology is used in studying sign languages despite  its sound-based etymolgy, in order to emphasise that the same level of structure exists as in spokenlanguage.\nHandshape refers to the configuration of the hands and fingers in a particular sign. Although there is no universal accepted transcription system for sign.",
